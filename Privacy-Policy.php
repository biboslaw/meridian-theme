	<h3 class="h3PrivayPolicy">Storage and Security of your personal data</h3>

	<p>
		We store your data on two different platforms:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>on-premises server</li>
		<li>public cloud-based storage</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		We use appropriate business systems and procedures to protect and safeguard the personal data you give us. We also use security procedures and technical and physical restrictions for accessing and using the personal data on our servers. Only authorised personnel are permitted to access personal data in the course of their work.
	</p>

	<p>
		Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology (SSL stands for 'Secure Sockets Layer' and creates encrypted connections).
	</p>

	<p>
		Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee the safety of your data during transmission, but once we receive your data it will be used and stored securely.
	</p>

	<p>
		When you register, we will ask you to choose a password which enables you to access the Online Courses and Content. You are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share this password with anyone.
	</p>

	<p>
		In addition, we (or third parties acting on our behalf) may also store or process information
		that we collect about you in countries outside the United Kingdom or outside the European
		Economic Area, which may have different standards of data protection than in the UK. We
		have put in place technical and organisational security measures to prevent the loss or
		unauthorised access of your personal information. However, whilst we have used our best
		efforts to ensure the security of your data, it is your responsibility to make an informed
		decision to avail yourself of our services and products or if your concerns about the handling
		of data require you to refrain from using our Website.
	</p>

	<h3 class="h3PrivayPolicy">Data Retention</h3>

	<p>
		We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate
		business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to
		comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
	</p>

	<p>
		When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,
		we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
		personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
		personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
	</p>

	<h3 class="h3PrivayPolicy">Children</h3>

	<p>
		We take seriously our legal obligation to protect the privacy of children, please see our
		Children Safety and Safeguarding Policy and our Children's Privacy Policy.
	</p>
